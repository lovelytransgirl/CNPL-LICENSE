# The "Seriously, Just Use It (No, Really)" License, Version 1.0

Look, let's not make this complicated.

**License:** Do Whatever The Heck You Want With It. Seriously.

What "It" is (code, art, ideas, sentient dust bunnies found in the repo) no longer matters. It is hereby relinquished to the wild, untamed chaos of the internet and your own brilliant/terrible schemes.

**Permissions:** You are granted explicit, absolute, and irrevocable permission to:
*   Copy it.
*   Modify it.
*   Distribute it.
*   Sell it.
*   Use it to build a potato-powered calculator.
*   Eat it with some sauce ( optional )
*   Use it to plot world domination (good luck!).
*   Use it as toilet paper (please don't).
*   Use it in conjunction with rubber chickens.
*   Do literally *anything* else that pops into your head, legal or otherwise (though I *highly* recommend sticking to the legal stuff, less paperwork).

**Obligations:** Zero. Nada. Zilch.
*   You don't need to credit me.
*   You don't need to ask permission.
*   You don't need to send me postcards (though postcards *are* nice).
*   You don't need to share your world domination plans (see above, less paperwork).

**Warranty:** HAHAHAHA. No. This is provided "AS IS". If it breaks, melts your computer, opens a portal to another dimension, or causes your cat to start speaking Latin, that's strictly a "you problem." I offer zero warranty, express or implied, for anything, ever.

**Basically:** Take it. It's yours now. I don't care what you do with it. Go forth and cause interesting things to happen.

Have fun!
